HTML Structure:
html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
This declares the document type and specifies that the language of the page is English (lang="en"). The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration tells the browser that this is an HTML5 document.

<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Simple HTML Form</title>
</head>
The <head> section contains metadata about the HTML document:

<meta charset="UTF-8"> specifies that the character encoding used is UTF-8, which supports a wide range of characters.

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> ensures the page is responsive and adjusts to different screen sizes, especially on mobile devices.

<title>Simple HTML Form</title> sets the title of the web page that appears in the browser tab.

<h1>Simple HTML Form</h1>
This is a heading (<h1>) that displays the text "Simple HTML Form" on the page. It's the main heading and is typically used for titles.

<form action="/submit" method="post">
The <form> tag defines a form. The action="/submit" attribute specifies the URL to which the form data will be sent upon submission. The method="post" attribute specifies that the form data will be sent using the HTTP POST method, which is used for sending data securely.

Form Inputs:
html

<label for="name">Name:</label>
<input type="text" id="name" name="name" required>
The <label for="name">Name:</label> tag creates a label for the "Name" input field. The for="name" attribute associates the label with the input field with the id="name", making the form more accessible.

<input type="text" id="name" name="name" required> creates a text input field where the user can type their name. The required attribute means that the user must fill out this field before submitting the form.

<br><br>
<br> is a line break, which adds space between form elements for better layout.

html

<label for="email">Email:</label>
<input type="email" id="email" name="email" required>
This creates an email input field. The type="email" attribute ensures the field expects a valid email format (e.g., someone@example.com). The required attribute makes it mandatory for the user to fill out this field.

<input type="radio" id="female" name="gender" value="Female">
<label for="female">Female</label>
This section creates radio buttons for selecting gender.

The name="gender" ensures that only one radio button can be selected at a time (since they share the same name).

Each radio button has a value attribute, which specifies the value sent when the form is submitted.

Each radio button is followed by a <label> element to make it clickable and provide a label to the user.

The for attribute of the label associates the label with the corresponding radio button by matching the id.

Recap:
This code defines a simple HTML form with various types of inputs, such as text, email, password, radio buttons, a checkbox, and a submit button.

The required attribute is used to enforce that the user must fill in certain fields before submitting the form.

The form data will be sent to /submit on the server using the POST method when the user clicks the submit button.
