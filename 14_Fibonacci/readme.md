<!DOCTYPE html>: Specifies the document type and version of HTML being used (HTML5).

<html lang="en">: Defines the language of the document as English.

<head>: Contains meta-information about the document like character set, viewport settings, and the title.

<meta charset="UTF-8">: Specifies the character encoding as UTF-8, which includes most characters from all known languages.

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">: Ensures the page is responsive on different devices, particularly mobile.

<title>Fibonacci Series</title>: Sets the title of the webpage that appears in the browser tab.

<body>: Contains the visible content of the page.

<h1>Fibonacci Series Generator</h1>: This is the heading displayed on the webpage, giving context about the page.

<label for="num">Enter the number of terms:</label>: This is a label for the input field, telling the user to enter the number of terms for the Fibonacci series.

<input type="number" id="num" placeholder="Enter number of terms" />: This is the input field where the user enters the number of Fibonacci terms they want to generate.

<button onclick="generateFibonacci()">Generate Fibonacci</button>: This button calls the generateFibonacci() JavaScript function when clicked, triggering the Fibonacci series generation.

<h2>Fibonacci Series:</h2>: This heading will be displayed before the Fibonacci series.

<p id="fibonacciOutput"></p>: This paragraph will display the generated Fibonacci series after the user clicks the button.

<script>: This is where JavaScript code begins. Everything between <script> and </script> is JavaScript.

function generateFibonacci() {: This defines a function named generateFibonacci. It contains the logic to generate the Fibonacci series.

const num = document.getElementById('num').value;:

document.getElementById('num'): This retrieves the HTML element with the id="num" (the input field where the user enters the number of terms).

.value: This gets the value that the user enters in the input field.

const num: This stores the user input in the num variable, which represents the number of Fibonacci terms to generate.

const fibonacci = [];: This initializes an empty array called fibonacci, where the generated Fibonacci series will be stored.

let n1 = 0, n2 = 1;: This initializes two variables n1 and n2 to represent the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence (0 and 1).

for (let i = 0; i < num; i++) {: This starts a for loop that will run num times (the number of terms the user wants in the Fibonacci series).

The loop uses the variable i to keep track of how many terms have been generated.

fibonacci.push(n1);: Inside the loop, this adds the current value of n1 (which is part of the Fibonacci series) to the fibonacci array.

let nextTerm = n1 + n2;: This calculates the next number in the Fibonacci sequence by adding the last two numbers (n1 and n2).

n1 = n2;: This sets n1 to the previous value of n2, so the next iteration of the loop can use the updated values.

n2 = nextTerm;: This sets n2 to the new calculated term (nextTerm), which is the sum of n1 and n2.

}: This closes the for loop.

document.getElementById('fibonacciOutput').textContent = fibonacci.join(', ');:

document.getElementById('fibonacciOutput'): This accesses the <p> element with the id="fibonacciOutput" where the result will be displayed.

.textContent = fibonacci.join(', ');: This converts the fibonacci array into a string by joining each number with a comma. This string is then set as the content of the paragraph, displaying the Fibonacci sequence to the user.

</script>: This ends the JavaScript section of the code.

How It Works:
The user enters a number in the input field (e.g., 5).

When the user clicks the "Generate Fibonacci" button, the generateFibonacci() function is called.

Inside the function, the Fibonacci series is generated up to the number of terms specified by the user.

The generated Fibonacci series is displayed as a comma-separated string in the paragraph with the id="fibonacciOutput".
